The answer is No, because the answer does not correspond to the expected output. This is because after the deduction of charges off 50  by the customer from the amount to be transferred, the sum falls below fifty thousand and according to the program written any sum less than fifty thousand attracts 25 charges ,solution to this problem is upon input of the amount, we would get the range it falls too, then we get the maximun amount and the fee to pay , we subtract the max from then fee then we  check if the amount inserted is greater than the value we got from the subtractin we did early then if so we get the next range and apply the charge to it,but there is actually a downside with this available solution doesnt work between the range of 50001 to 50025
