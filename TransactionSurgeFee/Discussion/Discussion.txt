sorry for responding back late had to refacture the code that i wrote fo the first one in this new file contaims condition necessary for the problem statement to be solved 
if the user input the amount he wants to send after getting the range then i safed it into a variable  fee , if the fee charge is greater than 0 then subtract the fee from the amount then save it into a variable now then i query the fee again to get the new range after then i checked if the formal fee equals the new fee then i would return it but if not i would return the first computation which is the amount inputed minus the first fee
